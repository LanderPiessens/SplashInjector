# Before you start #
Read all of [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3/themes/mod-splash-screen-image-injector-t3441999) to get the basic idea.
After this ill explain how to use my version

its actually quite simple... just follow this
	
	https://github.com/ethanbanker2428/SplashInjector
	cd SplashInjector
	./start

then choose your OS...		
then chose your device...
it will take the logo.bin and decode it
after edit the files you want too (located in /output)
then press y and it will encode it and package the file into a flashable zip
flash it...zips are located in output/splashscreen/splashscreen.zip
