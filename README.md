# Before you start #
Read all of [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3/themes/mod-splash-screen-image-injector-t3441999) to get the basic idea.
After this ill explain how to use my version

## how to use it? (LINUX) ##
its actually quite simple... just follow this
	
	https://github.com/ethanbanker2428/SplashInjector
	cd SplashInjector
	./inject

then follow the on screen steps

## how to use it? (WINDOWS PLEASE READ) ##
it gets more complicated on windows but not too bad. Heres the deal you need to download git bash from here https://git-scm.com/downloads . Then click the windows icon and search for git bash. open it and run these commands.
	
	cd Desktop
	git clone git://github.com/ethanbanker2428/SplashInjector
	cd SplashInjector
	./inject

then follow the on screen steps and chose the windows option.
